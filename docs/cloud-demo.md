## Demo Mode Limitations

!!! warning "Placeholder Processing"
    The cloud demo runs on Render's free tier with limited memory (512MB).
    Due to these constraints, it uses **placeholder processing** instead of real AI models.

### What This Means

| Feature | Demo Mode | Local Installation |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| Video upload | Works | Works |
| Frame extraction | Works | Works |
| Event detection | Placeholder | Real detection |
| Transcription | Placeholder | Whisper AI |
| Semantic search | Placeholder | Real embeddings |

### For Full Functionality

Use the [Local Setup Guide](local-setup.md) to install Lecture Mind on your own machine with:

- Real DINOv2 visual encoding
- Whisper audio transcription
- FAISS semantic search

## Technical Details

### Infrastructure

- **Hosting**: Render.com (Free tier)
- **Memory**: 512MB
- **Storage**: Ephemeral (files deleted on restart)
- **Cold Start**: ~30 seconds if inactive

### API Access

The demo also exposes the REST API:

- **Swagger UI**: [/docs](https://lecture-mind.onrender.com/docs)
- **ReDoc**: [/redoc](https://lecture-mind.onrender.com/redoc)

### Rate Limits

- 10 uploads per minute per IP
- 100MB maximum file size

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Service Unavailable"

The demo may be sleeping due to inactivity. Wait 30 seconds and refresh.

### "Processing Failed"

Try with a smaller video file (<50MB). Large files may timeout.

### "Slow Processing"

Free tier has limited CPU. Processing may take longer than local installation.
