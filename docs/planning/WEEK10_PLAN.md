# Week 10 Plan: Foundation + Architecture

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Duration:** 5 days @ 4 hours/day = 20 hours total
**Goal:** Establish the architectural foundation for Student Playground features
**Status:** DRAFT - Pending hostile-reviewer approval

---

## Carry-Over from Week 9

### Fix Demo GIF (Priority: HIGH)
The hostile review (REVIEW_demo_gif.md) flagged critical issues:
- **[C1]** Missing search functionality demo - GIF shows only static UI states
- **[C2]** No AI/ML demonstration - viewers never see actual processing/results
- **[M4]** Study Tools frame is truncated

**Action Required:**
- [ ] Record new GIF showing: upload → processing → search query → results
- [ ] Include actual search results (even if from local install)
- [ ] Update docs/assets/demo.gif
- [ ] Update README if needed

**Time estimate:** 1-2 hours

## Overview

- **Theme:** Storage architecture, data models, and design system enhancement
- **Hours:** 20h total
- **Agents:** architect, frontend-design, hostile-reviewer
- **Critical Path:** IndexedDB storage layer must complete before any feature work in Week 11+

```

## Risks

| ID | Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|----|------|--------|------------|------------|
| R1 | IndexedDB browser incompatibility | HIGH | LOW | Test early on Safari, fallback to localStorage for critical data |
| R2 | 60fps animation target missed | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Use CSS-only animations, avoid JS-driven frame updates |
| R3 | Model schema changes later | MEDIUM | HIGH | Design for schema migrations from day 1 (version field) |
| R4 | Test coverage shortfall | MEDIUM | LOW | Prioritize storage layer tests, UI tests in Week 15 |
| R5 | Design token conflicts with existing | LOW | MEDIUM | Namespace new tokens with `--sp-` prefix (student playground) |

### Mitigation Details

**R1 - IndexedDB Compatibility:**
```javascript
// Feature detection with fallback
const hasIndexedDB = () => {
  try {
    return !!window.indexedDB;
  } catch (e) {
    return false;
  }
};

// Safari private browsing fallback
if (!hasIndexedDB()) {
  console.warn('IndexedDB unavailable, using in-memory storage');
  return new InMemoryStorage();
}
```

**R3 - Schema Migrations:**
```javascript
// Built-in migration support
const migrations = {
  1: (db) => { /* initial schema */ },
  2: (db) => { /* add courseId index */ },
  // ... future migrations
};
```

### Hostile Review Focus Areas

```markdown
## HOSTILE_REVIEWER: Week 10 Review Focus

Priority 1 (Security):
- [ ] Storage API cannot be exploited for XSS
- [ ] No dangerous code execution patterns with user data
- [ ] No innerHTML with user-provided content
- [ ] Data validation prevents injection attacks

Priority 2 (Reliability):
- [ ] IndexedDB quota handling
- [ ] Graceful degradation without IndexedDB
- [ ] Data integrity on concurrent access

Priority 3 (Performance):
- [ ] Animations GPU-composited
- [ ] No memory leaks in animation loops
- [ ] Lazy loading of animation assets

Priority 4 (Maintainability):
- [ ] Clear separation of concerns
- [ ] Models independent of storage implementation
- [ ] Animation system is declarative, not imperative
```

## Week 11 Preview (Blocked by Week 10 Gate)

Once hostile-reviewer approves Week 10 deliverables:

| Task | Hours | Agent | Dependency |
|------|-------|-------|------------|
| Flashcard data model finalization | 2h | architect | Week 10 models |
| Auto-generation from transcript | 6h | ml-engineer | Flashcard model |
| SM-2 spaced repetition algorithm | 4h | ml-engineer | Flashcard model |
| Card UI with flip animation | 4h | frontend-design | Animation framework |
| Study session flow | 4h | frontend-design | All above |

---

## Notes

### Existing Assets (Leverage, Don't Rebuild)

The project already has:
- `tokens.css` - Comprehensive design token system (colors, typography, spacing, motion)
- `animations.css` - Premium animations (particles, aurora, tilt cards, celebrations)
- `components.css` - Base component styles

**Strategy:** Extend existing files rather than creating parallel systems.

### Technology Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Alternative Considered |
|----------|-----------|------------------------|
| IndexedDB over localStorage | Supports large data, async API | localStorage has 5MB limit |
| CSS-only animations over GSAP | No dependencies, better performance | GSAP adds 30KB |
| JSDoc over TypeScript | Faster development, no build step | TypeScript requires tooling |

### File Structure After Week 10
